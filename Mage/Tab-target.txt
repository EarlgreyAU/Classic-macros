For leveling, I like to add the following to my Frostbolt/Fireball macros, they automatically “tab-target” to new enemies, makes it easier to chain cast/pull.

/cleartarget [dead][help]
/targetenemy [noexists]



It will clear your current target if you’re targeting a dead enemy, or a friendly NPC/player. 
If you’re then not targeting anything, it will target the closest enemy. 


Frostbolt Example:

#showtooltip
/cleartarget [dead][help]
/targetenemy [noexists]
/cast [mod:ctrl]Frostbolt(Rank 1);Frostbolt

If you want, you can also add /stand [exists,harm,nodead] after the showtooltip for leveling.
