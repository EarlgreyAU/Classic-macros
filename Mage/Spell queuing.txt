A work around for spell queuing for those with little/no latency issues.

#showtooltip Mind Quickening Gem
/run local _,_,lagHome = GetNetStats(); sqw = math.min(400, lagHome * 2); SetCVar("SpellQueueWindow", sqw)
/use 13
/cast Frostbolt(rank 10)

This prevents a spell queued frostbolt from blocking the trinket effect being activated in the macro, by
reducing the spell queue window enough to allow you to use trinket and start frostbolt cast without losing time.
This works for gems as well.

Things to consider/test: 

(1) lagHome or lagWorld, which is the "right" one. 
In practice they are within 1 millisecond, so it's probably insignificant. 

(2) lagHome * 2 is current place holder, but is probably not what you want. 
It might be lagHome * 2 + 20 or lagHome * 2 - 25 or anything in between or even more. 
The best value here depends on the fluctuations of your latency on the ~30 second timescale, 
as GetNetStats only updates every 30 seconds, as well as how fast you are mashing buttons.

/console SpellQueueWindow sqw errors and sets it to 0.
0 still lets you mash it obviously, but then you are losing your latency time.
