A work around for Spell Queing for those with little/no latency issues.

#showtooltip mind quickening gem
/console SpellQueueWindow 0
/use 13
/cast Frostbolt(rank 10)

You can also adjust the Spell Queue window closer to your server MS instead of setting it to 0

and then i make a separate macro for my frostbolts to include spell queing

#showtooltip frostbolt
/console SpellQueueWindow 400
/cast Frostbolt(rank 10)

Works for gems and other trinkets as well.

Edit

So I didn't figure this out, thanks to @elio & @tom allon 

You can set the spellque window to always register ur current MS to avoid as much time loss as possible.

/run local ,,_,lagHome = GetNetStats() s = lagHome * 2
/console SpellQueueWindow s

Add that instead of just /console SpellQueueWindow 0
And it should always replace the SpellQueueWindow with your current MS.
