A work around for Spell Queing for those with little/no latency issues.

#showtooltip mind quickening gem
/console SpellQueueWindow 0
/use 13
/cast Frostbolt(rank 10)

You can also adjust the Spell Queue window closer to your server MS instead of setting it to 0

and then i make a separate macro for my frostbolts to include spell queing

#showtooltip frostbolt
/console SpellQueueWindow 400
/cast Frostbolt(rank 10)

Works for gems and other trinkets as well.

You can set the spellque window to always register ur current MS to avoid as much time loss as possible.

/run local ,,_,lagHome = GetNetStats() s = lagHome * 2
/console SpellQueueWindow s

Add that instead of just /console SpellQueueWindow 0
And it should always replace the SpellQueueWindow with your current MS.


All those spell queue windows with getnetstats are bugged btw, this is the way to do it:

#showtooltip Mind Quickening Gem
/run local _,_,lagHome = GetNetStats(); sqw = math.min(400, lagHome * 2); SetCVar("SpellQueueWindow", sqw)
/use 13
/cast Frostbolt(rank 10)
