A work around for Spell Queing for those with little/no latency issues.

#showtooltip mind quickening gem
/console SpellQueueWindow 0
/use 13
/cast Frostbolt(rank 10)


Adjust the Spell queue window closer to your server delay instead of setting it to 0
and then make a separate macro for frostbolts to include spell queue.

#showtooltip frostbolt
/console SpellQueueWindow 400
/cast Frostbolt(rank 10)

Works for gems and other trinkets as well.


Set the spell queue window to always register your current latency to avoid as much time loss as possible.

/run local ,,_,lagHome = GetNetStats() s = lagHome * 2
/console SpellQueueWindow s

Add that instead of just /console SpellQueueWindow 0
and it should always replace the SpellQueueWindow with your current latency.


All those spell queue windows with getnetstats are bugged btw, this is the way to do it:

#showtooltip Mind Quickening Gem
/run local _,_,lagHome = GetNetStats(); sqw = math.min(400, lagHome * 2); SetCVar("SpellQueueWindow", sqw)
/use 13
/cast Frostbolt(rank 10)


This prevents a spell queued frostbolt in a trinket macro from preventing the trinket being activated by
reducing spell queue enough to allow you to use trinket and start frostbolt cast without losing time.
