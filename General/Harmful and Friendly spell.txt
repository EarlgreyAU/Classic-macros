Combining a harmful spell with a friendly spell:

This macro does 4 things with a single action button....

1. If your target is alive and hostile/neutral, a harmful spell will be used.

2. If your target is alive and friendly, a friendly spell will be used (whether that's a healing spell, a buff, or whatever you choose)

3. If your target is DEAD and friendly, a resurrection spell will be used

4. If your target is DEAD and hostile/neutral, you current target will be wiped and a new (alive) target will be selected
