MACRO THAT SHOULD BE USED WITH ALL FRIENDLY SPELLS

As far as I'm concerned, this functionality should be the default for friendly spells.


General Form

/cast [@mouseover,nodead,help][nodead,help][@player] __friendly_targetable_spell__



Example

/cast [@mouseover,nodead,help][nodead,help][@player] Flash Heal
