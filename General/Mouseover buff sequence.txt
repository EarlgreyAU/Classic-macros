NIFTY MOUSEOVER BUFF SEQUENCE MACRO

This will cast a sequence of spells on your mouseover. Once you've acquired your target, you can move your mouse.
Choose a new target by activating the macro while mousing over a new target. The sequence will reset and you can start again.


General Form

/target [@mouseover,help,nodead] mouseover
/castsequence reset=target __spell_1__[, __spell_2__[, __spell_3__[, ...]]]



Note

Each run of the /castsequence, it will assign mouseover to target, if you have a mouseover; but, since it will be the same person the reset condition of the /castsequence won't be met, and it will just continue. If you don't have a mouseover, it will keep your current target and continue the sequence.



Example

/target [@mouseover,help,nodead] mouseover
/castsequence reset=target Shadow Protection, Power Word: Fortitude, Divine Spirit
