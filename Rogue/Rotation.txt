Rotation based macro

/castsequence reset=0.3 0,0,0,<spell 4>
/castsequence reset=0.3 0,0,<spell 3>
/castsequence reset=0.3 0,<spell 2>
/castsequence reset=0.3 <spell 1>


So this is what happens on each click (try to see the macro above as columns of spells rather than rows!):

1st click (first column of spells): cast 0, cast 0, cast 0, cast <spell 1>
2nd click (second column of spells): cast 0, cast 0, cast <spell 2>
3rd click (third column of spells): cast 0, cast <spell 3>
4th click (fourth column of spells): cast <spell 4>
