 [Guide] Combat Rogue Macro Guide - Advance


    1. No GCD

    /cast <spell 1>
    /cast <spell 2>

   
    2. Cast sequences

    /castsequence [condition] reset=4,target <spell 1>, <spell 2>, <spell 3>

   
    3. Modifier macros

    /cast [nomod] <spell 1>
    /cast [mod:shift] <spell 2>
    /cast [mod:alt] <spell 3>
    /cast [mod:ctrl] <spell 4>

  
    3. Rotation based macro

    /castsequence reset=0.3 0,0,0,<spell 4>
    /castsequence reset=0.3 0,0,<spell 3>
    /castsequence reset=0.3 0,<spell 2>
    /castsequence reset=0.3 <spell 1>


    So this is what happens on each click (try to see the macro above as columns of spells rather than rows!):

    1st click (first column of spells): cast 0, cast 0, cast 0, cast <spell 1>
    2nd click (second column of spells): cast 0, cast 0, cast <spell 2>
    3rd click (third column of spells): cast 0, cast <spell 3>
    4th click (fourth column of spells): cast <spell 4>

   

    SAP :

    #showtooltip [mod:shift] Blind; Sap
    /castsequence [nomod] reset=target 0,Redirect
    /castsequence [nomod] reset=target Sap
    /cast [mod:shift] Blind

   
    OPEN :

    Casters/Healers -

    /castsequence [nomod] reset=target garrote, expose armor, slice and dice
    /cast [mod:shift] Revealing strike

    Melee -

    /castsequence [nomod] reset=target Cheap shot, expose armor, slice and dice
    

    Like I mentioned before, the rogue opener is usually the one thing that can't be avoided (in most cases, especially when you have subterfuge talent). What you do is cast the above spells to apply combo points, revealing strike debuff AND consume combo points on slice and dice. Just spam the above marco :D

    Different rogues have different openers. See what works for you and edit the above sequence.

    On modifier shift, it casts revealing strike in case i need only the debuff for a followup kidney shot.


    BURST :

    #showtooltip [mod:shift] Adrenaline Rush; Sinister Strike
    /cast Sinister Strike
    /cast Adrenaline Rush
    /use 13


    Note : 13 = slot id for first trinket and 14 = slot id for second trinket.


    SPAM :

    /cast [nomod] Sinister Strike
    /cast [mod:shift] Eviscerate

    Simple macro, build up points and consume with eviscerate. Or you can just build up points and then use kidney shot (in COUNTER macro below) for stun locking.


    VANISH :

    #showtooltip [mod:shift] Vanish; Stealth
    /stopattack
    /stopcasting
    /dismount [mounted]
    /cast [nocombat] !Stealth
    /cast [nocombat,stealth] Pick pocket
    /castsequence [mod:shift] reset=6 Vanish, feint
    /cast [mod:shift] Cloak of Shadows
    /cast [mod:shift] Sprint
    /cast [mod:shift] Preparation

    

    SPRINT :

    /cast [nomod] Burst of speed
    /cast [mod:shift] Sprint




    COUNTER :

    /cast [nomod] Kidney shot
    /cast [mod:shift] kick
  


    CLEANSE :

    /cast [nomod] 14
    /cast [mod:shift] Will of the forsaken



    Set max camera distance (lets you scroll your view to max distance!)

    /script SetCVar("cameraDistanceMax",30)


    Teleport out of dungeon!

    /run LFGTeleport(true)

    

    Delete all grey items from bag, cuz i am a professional!

    /run for bag = 0, 4 do for slot = 1, GetContainerNumSlots(bag) do local name = GetContainerItemLink(bag,slot) if name and string.find(name,"ff9d9d9d") then PickupContainerItem(bag,slot) DeleteCursorItem() end end end
