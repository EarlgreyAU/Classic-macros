Consider the macro below to be a default for all of your skill shots. This example casts Serpent Sting.

#showtooltip
/targetenemy [noexists][dead][help]
/cast Serpent Sting



The first line is automatic targeting. The second line will cast your ability.

If you also wish to initiate your Auto Shot alongside your other shots, as I prefer, use the following macro instead.

#showtooltip
/targetenemy [noexists][dead][help]
/cast Arcane Shot(rank 1)
/cast !Auto Shot
/startattack



Alternatively, the following shorter macro will attempt to enable your Auto Shot, but will not switch to melee attack if you're too close to your target.

#showtooltip
/targetenemy [noexists][dead][help]
/cast Arcane Shot(rank 1)
/cast !Auto Shot
