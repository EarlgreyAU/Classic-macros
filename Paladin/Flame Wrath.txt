From Wisdom go Command, change weapon when you see the animation that it will hit target (means the 2 Hander will get spell damage from Lok'amir).
After the swing if it did not trigger the effect use judgement of Command. If it did not trigger again use Seal of Righteousness.
It should proc in ~ 3 seconds, but don't waste any swings, change weapon in the right moment, or you will have to wait 4 seconds for next swing.
Reckoning and parry haste helps. This is the rotation that gives the best proc chance. It's not guaranteed, but you will do 5-6 attacks in 2 seconds.
