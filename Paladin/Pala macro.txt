Macro Guide

Here is a list of helpful macros I found in WoW forums and various other websites. If one you use is not listed, let me know I will add it.

Individual Player Holy Light
Cast Holy Light/Flash of Light on a player in your party, or yourself, only.

/cast [help] Holy Light; [target=”x”] Holy Light
“x” is Party(1-4), thus 5 individual Macros must be made with “Player” replacing “x” to target yourself. You can always replace the spell name with a different spell, i.e Flash of Light.

Easy Seal and Judgement
Judge an enemy with one button or recast a Seal. Important: A seal must already be activated to achieve the Judgment effect.

/cast Judgement
/stopcasting
/cast Seal of X
“X” is the name of the Seal, i.e. Wisdom, Crusader etc.

One touch Bubble-Bandage
/cast Divine Shield
/stopcasting
/useitem Heavy Runecloth Bandage, [target=player,help]
Cast Divine Shield and bandage yourself. This conserves mana when doing this rather than casting Holy Light.

Seal of Command
/castsequence reset=30 Seal of Command, Judgement

Seal of the Crusader
/castsequence reset=30,target/combat Seal of the Crusader, Judgement

Seal of Light
/castsequence reset=30 Seal of Light, Judgement

Seal of Justice
/castsequence reset=30 Seal of Justice, Judgement

Special Flash of Light Cast Flash of Light on a friend or target’s target

Self Casting
/cast [target=player] Flash of Light
This will also cast Flash of Light on yourself, regardless of target. You will also not lose your current target.



/cast [help] Flash of Light; [target=player] Flash of Light
This will cast Flash of Light if the target is friendly. In any other case (enemy or no target selected), it will cast it on you. You will also not lose your current target. Note that there are several ways of making this macro:



/cast [target=player, harm] Flash of Light; [help] Flash of Light – is another example



Defensive Macros
These following macros are for Instance/Raid oriented situations.



Cast BoP under the gaze of an enemy Another snoozer to “taunt” mobs with very little hassle
/cast [help,target=target] Blessing of Protection; [target=targettarget,help] Blessing of Protection



Bless Specific Macros
These macros bless players depending on pre-set Blessing in the marco.

GBL Cast Great Blessing of Light for the raid
/cast [raid] Greater Blessing of Light; [help] Blessing of Light; [target=player] Greater Blessing of Light

These are miscellaneous macros for combat or non-combat situations.

Avoidance Macro
Here is a great macro that will calculate your avoidance with and without buffs.

/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(GetDodgeChance()+GetBlockChance()+GetParryChance()+5+(GetCombatRating(CR_DEFENSE_SKILL)*150/355 + 20)*0.04,1,0.5,0)
