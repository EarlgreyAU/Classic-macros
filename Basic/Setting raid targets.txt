SETTING RAID TARGETS

This will cover the two marking API functions and their differences.


Choose Your API Call

There are two possibilities for which API you can call to set a raid target.
--Puts a raid target marker on a unit.
SetRaidTarget("unit", index)
or
--Puts a raid target marker on a unit, toggling it off if the same index is called twice.
SetRaidTargetIcon("unit",index)
