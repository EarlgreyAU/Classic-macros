The Spell Queue Window is the time in milliseconds in which you're allowed to tell WoW's servers about the next spell you want to cast before your 
current cast is finished. This defaults to 400 milliseconds. Without this feature, you would experience a large delay (2x average latency) between spells. 
This also applies to instant-cast spells on the Global Cool-down (GCD). The Spell Queue Window benefits everyone, no matter how low your internet latency is.

When you queue a spell, the queue-system does not allow you to change that spell. For that reason, some find that lowering the Spell Queue Window 
value improves how spell-casting feels. Be careful not to set the value too low or spell-queueing will not work properly. The recommended delay is at 
least 100ms higher than your average latency.
