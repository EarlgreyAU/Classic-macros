@unit or target=unit — Sets the condition target to unit (an arbitrary string, although unitIds may be more useful when combined with some of the other conditionals); always considered satisfied.
@player - Casts the spell towards the player (you) regardless of what you have targeted. Good example being the previously shown Self-Devour macro.
@pet - Casts the spell towards your pet regardless of what you have targeted.
@targetpet - Casts the spell towards your target’s pet regardless of what you have targeted.
@mouseover - Casts the spell towards the unit your cursor is floating over. This is an extremely important modifier for pvp, for two reasons: first, it eliminates the time/hassle of clicking or tab targeting. Second, it doesn’t show which target you are casting your spell towards. Make sure you have important curses, fear, spell lock, etc, on mouseover.
@cursor - Similar to mouseover, but this is for “aimed” abilities with reticules like Rain of Fire, Inferno, and Iron Grenade. With this modifier, you won’t have to activate the ability and then click the location – the spell will automatically cast at the location of your mouse pointer.
@targettarget - Casts at your target’s target. This is pretty useful in PVP; for example, you can fear the target of your healer.
Target tags can be chained together as well. For example, @targettargetpettarget will cast at your target’s target’s pet’s target.

Conditionals don't work with /run. For modifiers, you need the APIs IsShiftKeyDown(), IsControlKeyDown() and IsAltKeyDown(). 
For buttons you need the API GetMouseButtonClicked(), which returns one of "LeftButton", "MiddleButton", "RightButton", or "ButtonN" where N is 4-15 (for extra mouse buttons).
