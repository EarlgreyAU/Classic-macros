Conditionals don't work with /run. For modifiers, you need the APIs IsShiftKeyDown(), IsControlKeyDown() and IsAltKeyDown(). 
For buttons you need the API GetMouseButtonClicked(), which returns one of "LeftButton", "MiddleButton", "RightButton", or "ButtonN" where N is 4-15 (for extra mouse buttons).
