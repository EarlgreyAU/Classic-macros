- You can get rid of a lot of spaces in macros. Any space after ; , ] can safely be removed.

- /use is the same as /cast for spells.

- Just have #showtooltip don't specify which ability, and it will change tooltip based on the one it will cast first (icon changes too).

- If you use [] that will always use the spell because the conditions are always met.
